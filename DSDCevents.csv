Everything in and out of a Bayesian analysis is probability and can be combined or broken apart according to the rules of probability. But understanding code and sampling algorithms -- really understanding the algorithms and computation -- and a much deeper grasp of probability distribution theory are much more important in understanding Bayesian inference earlier on.<\/p>\n<p>This tutorial is an introduction to the basic basics of Bayesian inference through a self-contained example involving data simulation and inference on a binomial proportion, such as vote share in a two-way election or a basketball player's free-throw percentage. Time allowing, we will also introduce some more advanced concepts. It is meant to help people with a general understanding of traditional statistics and probability take that first step towards drinking the Bayesian kool-aid. It is delicious stuff, I promise. Tastes like genuine reductions in uncertainty. And cherries.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bio:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Rob Mealey has a BA in Political Science from St. Michael College and an MS in Applied Economics from Johns Hopkins.
